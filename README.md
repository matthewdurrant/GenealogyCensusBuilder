# Genealogy Census Builder
## TODO Better name

### A Blazor tool to easily manage census data from online databases, connecting households across time and drawing conclusions from evidence.

As a hobbyist studying genealogy, I got frustrated with online databases that hold remarkable stores of information but then do nothing useful with it. Once you get past the layer of "good" references you enter the twilight zone, where everyone is called Elizabeth, married a man called John and had three children called Elizabeth, John and Mary.

The only way to untangle this mess is to properly sort and organise household data from censuses, but no service I know of allows you to see census data in the context it so sorely needs:
- Where did these people live before the census?
- Where did they go on to after the census?
- Who were their neighbours?
- Were they newcomers, or had their family lived there for generations?

This app is designed to allow you to flitter easily from census to census, soaring over the villages of your ancestors to put together a true picture of who lived where and when.
